# Examples for raylib-beef

This repository contains a few examples for [raylib-beef](https://github.com/M0n7y5/raylib-beef) which were translated from C to beef.

Note that unlike the examples of the original raylib, which has one executable per example, there is only one executable here.
It is single launcher app which can start any of the examples:
